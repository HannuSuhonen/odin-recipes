    <h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>
    <p> Very tasty chicken with rice and salsa! Goes very well with grilled chicken. </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 cup salsa</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, mis together the paprika, garlic powder, dried thyme, salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the chicken breasts and use your hands to massage the oil into the chicken</li>
        <li>Rub the spice mixture over thoroughly over both sides of the chicken breasts, making sure to coat them evenly</li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan over medium high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts t the pan and cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until golder brown and cooked through</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice. Rinse the rice in a fine mesh strainer until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken broth and salt to a boil. Add the rinsed rice, stir well, and reduce the heat to low. Cover the saucepan and simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed. You can also do this whole process in a rice cooker. Add the broth directly to the water and let it cook.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken and rice are done, serve the chicken with a side of rice and salsa.</li>
        <li>To serve, spoon some rice onto the plate, and place a cooked chicken breast on top of the rice. Spoon some salsa over the chicken and rice.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
